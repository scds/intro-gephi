# Welcome to Network Visualizations with Gephi 

Learn to graph data and visualize networks at this workshop on [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). Devon Mordell (Educational Developer, MacPherson Institute) will teach participants how graph data can help express relationships between entities and visualize networks for Humanities scholars. The group will use a visualization tool intended for social network analysis to map and identify relationships within a dataset scraped from Twitter.

Proceed to the [Preparation](preparation) page to get started.
