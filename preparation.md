# Workshop preparation 
  
## 1. Get the data
For the workshop, we will be using a dataset that has been processed in advance, but please feel free to have a dataset you’d like to work with handy and we can discuss how you might approach it at the end of the workshop.

<!--
You will have an opportunity to download the data during the workshop; however, if you would like to do so ahead of time, it can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/scds/intro-tableau/raw/main/data/humdata_GHGEmissionsGES.xlsx). -->

## 2. Get the software
In this tutorial, we will be using an open source software application called [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) to visualize the graph data. We ask that you [download](https://gephi.org/users/download/) Gephi in advance of the workshop; it’s a robust tool, but there is occasionally some troubleshooting involved in getting it up and running. You may wish to review the [system requirements](https://gephi.org/users/requirements/) for Gephi if it doesn’t work for you “out of the box”. 

If you experience issues opening Gephi on the computer you will be using for the workshop, please email the [Sherman Centre](mailto:scds@mcmaster.ca) as soon as possible so that we can help you resolve them in advance.
